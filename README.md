# WebScrapper
A simple web scrapper that sends an email to the user if the price of a particular product on amazon has fallen.


Requirements:
beautiful soup library(pip install bs4)
time library(built-in)
smtlib library(built-in)
request library(pip install requests)
Enable less secure logins on your google account
User agent(google it from a brower)

Recommendation:
If possible use a conda environment
Pycharm is the best ide

As of now their is just one .py file so it has no dependencies apart from the libraries mentioned.

Don't keep sending requests all the time, once in 10 minutes is sufficient
